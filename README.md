# Hangman
In the game of Hangman, the computer chooses a word at random from a given list of words. This word is the answer. The player then tries to guess the word, by guessing one letter at a time. Whenever the player guesses a letter that is in the answer, all occurrences of that letter are revealed to the player. For every wrong guess of a letter one life is deducted from the playerâ€™s existing lives. The game ends when the player has guessed every letter in the word, before he uses up all of his life or when he uses up all of his lives before guessing the word. This program is an interactive Hangman game. The focus is to use and manipulate strings and loops also graphics have been employed to make the program look attractive to the player.

This project was made as part of an Investigatory project for class XII, for the subject of Computer Science in the academic year 2016-17.
